# WEB102 Prework - SM Money

Submitted by: Maya Ali 

SM Money is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
I created a search bar! This search lets you search for the name of a game that a user may want, and it gets filtered and returns the result. 

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
